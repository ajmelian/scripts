mail2bash
=========

Executes the commands in an email if the propper password is provided in that 
email. Otherwise does nothing.

It is useful when you need to execute basic commands on a server and you 
can't use SSH. Using this script is dangerous if any password is revelaed
and since they're send in text plain, I would not recommend this script for
high security servers.

You can always add signature verification usign GnuPG :) for me it served its
purpose with my server at home because I couldn't use SSH to connect some years
ago.

Configure the script with username, password and execute it using cron.

Example of an email containing commands. Default password: "commands"

<commands>
sync
reboot
</commands>

Example usign password "123password"

<123password>
sync
reboot
</123password>
