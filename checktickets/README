CheckTickets
============

CheckTicket is a very simple script written in less than two minutes some years
ago to check if a text is or not present in a web. In that case, it sends you a
reminder email.

I used it to check when certain tickets would be available.
It does not book them at all :)

Open and edit checktickets.php to configure the scripts. It is very simple.

Observations
------------

* This PHP script uses phpmailer to send you an email (included).
* Requires the use of cron or something similar.
